## Html
* In the html file there are just a couple of div's and links to the stylesheets.

## Scss
* In the scss is a start of the styling (still working on).

## JavaScript
* In the JavaScript there is a fetch that will get the information needed from the API. 
* Right now I am asking for only 1 person but you can ask for more by changing the results=__**1**__&format=json to a higher number.
* There are also a couple **const** with **querySelector** and **createElement**.
* With the **querySelector** I can select a div from the **HTML** file.
* With the **createElement** I am creating a new element (div).
* Within in the **document.createElement** I am using **document.createElement** to make a class within the div.
